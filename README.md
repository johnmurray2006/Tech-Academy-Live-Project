# Tech-Academy-Live-Project
Hello, I worked on a two week sprint with a five man team as my live project.
These are the different code piece that I changed for the live project.
Most of the coding changes I did were to the front-end website to enhance the end users experiences. I moved icons around, changed color and font for different headers. Made new buttons for a page, the majority of changes were made on different view or model pages with styling done on the main CSS stying page. The overall experience was excellent learning to navigate a large website connecting the changes on each page.
